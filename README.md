# Cyber Security Internship – Task 3

## Task Title
Networking Basics for Cyber Security

## Description
Networking is a core component of cyber security as data is continuously transmitted between devices over networks. This task focuses on understanding basic networking concepts and analyzing real-time network traffic using Wireshark.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Wi-Fi Network
- Windows Operating System

## Networking Concepts Covered
- IP Address
- MAC Address
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- DNS (Domain Name System)

## Packet Capture Process
Live network traffic was captured using Wireshark over a Wi-Fi connection. Multiple websites were accessed to generate traffic, and the capture was stopped after sufficient packets were collected for analysis.

## Packet Analysis and Observations
- DNS queries were observed for resolving domain names such as `realtime.chatgpt.com`
- Encrypted HTTPS traffic using TLSv1.2 was identified
- TCP communication and three-way handshake were observed
- Difference between plain-text (HTTP) and encrypted (HTTPS) traffic was analyzed

## Deliverables
- 3 (PDF)
- Wireshark Packet Capture File (.pcapng)
